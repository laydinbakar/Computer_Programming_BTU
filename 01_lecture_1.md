### Basic Terminal Commands on Ubuntu
Open a Terminal Window by
* pressing `Windows Key` and typing `Terminal`,
* pressing `ctrl+alt+t`,
* or clicking the Terminal Icon on the left dock.
### 1. `pwd`
`pwd` stands for `Pring Work Directory` on Linux. 
Terminal opens at the `home` directory by default in Ubuntu.
If you type `pwd` and press `Enter` you will see your `home` directory.
```
pwd
/home/la
```
in my case.
